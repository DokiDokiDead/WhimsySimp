WhimySimp Game Repository
=========================

This is the Github Repository for the WhimsySimp Project. Here will be where we store and maintain the game code for WhimsySimp.

Installation
============

describe how to install renpy and/or any other tools we may use in the future.

Wiki/Documentation
==================

decide to add documentation in a google drive or make a wiki and use here.

I personally would like to keep documentation internally since we'd likely have to link to other groups's work such as their art folder and such. Much easier imo to link around in google docs.

Credits
=======

put credits here.

License
=======

determine and add a license here for the code.
