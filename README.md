WhimySimp Game Repository
=========================

This is the Github Repository for the WhimsySimp Project. Here will be where we store and maintain the game code for WhimsySimp.

Installation
============

Describe how to install renpy and/or any other tools we may use in the future.


Download Ren'Py version 7.4.7 from https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.7 for your opperating system. (Game is being developed for Windwos first due to it's popularity, it will be ported to other Operating Systems later.)

Download the WhimsySimp Game Repository from https://github.com/DokiDokiDead/WhimsySimp.git and add it to your Ren'Py installation folder(Example: D:\Program Files\Ren'Py\renpy-7.4.7-sdk ). 

For Windows: Open Ren'Py via the renpy.exe file inside your installation folder. There will be a menu labled "Projects", in which there will be three game projects available: "Tutorial" "The Question" and "WhimsySimp-Master", assuming all you have done is add this game to a fresh install.
Click on "WhimsySimp-Master" and start fiddling about with your branch of the game!
